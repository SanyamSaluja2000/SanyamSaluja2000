I am Sanyam, an accomplished software developer with a background as an Associate Consultant at Oracle. My expertise spans backend and frontend development, focusing on Java with Spring Boot for building robust RESTful APIs and microservices. On the frontend, I specialize in creating responsive web applications using React.js, adeptly managing state with Redux. I bring extensive experience in database technologies, including Oracle for relational databases and MongoDB for NoSQL solutions. Proficient in Git and GitHub for version control and repository management, I apply strong analytical skills and a proactive problem-solving approach to deliver efficient, scalable solutions.
